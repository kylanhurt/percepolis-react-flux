# Percepolis (Flux + React)

The purpose of this project is to create a web application running on React + Flux and accessing an API to create a tool for submitting and reviewing entities. This is a transformation of my **larang-rebuild** project. Keep in mind that the API this uses is built upon Laravel (actually located in the larang-rebuild project's /api folder for the time being), although any decent implementation of the back-end should suffice.
